🔹 Sample Inputs

1️⃣ Sad Example:
"I got bullied at school today. Some classmates were laughing at me in the hallway. I tried to ignore it, but it really hurt my feelings. During lunch, I stayed by myself. On the way home, I kept thinking about what happened. It made me feel lonely and upset for the rest of the day."
2️⃣ Happy Example:
"I got a job offer today. I have been waiting for this opportunity for weeks. I spent the morning checking my email constantly. When I saw the message, I smiled and told my family. I spent the afternoon planning how to start this new chapter. Everything feels exciting and new."
3️⃣ Neutral Example:
"I went to the park this afternoon. The weather was nice, and a few people were walking their dogs. I sat on a bench and watched the birds for a while. Later, I walked around the playground. Nothing unusual happened, but it was calm and quiet. I headed home in the evening."
